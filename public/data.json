Financial performance information that differs from that included in Item 19 may be given only if (1) a franchisor provides the actual records of an existing outlet you are considering buying; or (2) a franchisor supplements the information provided in this Item 19, for example, by providing information about possible performance at a particular location or under particular circumstances. The following are material financial and operations characteristics of the affiliate-owned outlet that are reasonably anticipated to differ materially from future operational franchise outlets: • The majority of our franchised locations will initially utilize an owner-operator model in which the franchisees deliver most or all of the personal training sessions to clients. In contrast, our affiliate-owned outlet pays other personal trainers to deliver most or all client sessions. • Our affiliate-owned outlet employs several workers who perform functions that will be handled by the franchisee or by the franchisor. Written substantiation for the financial performance representation will be made available to the prospective franchisee upon reasonable request. Other than the financial performance representations contained in this Item 19, we do not make any representations about a franchisee’s future financial performance or the past financial performance of company-owned or franchised outlets. We also do not authorize our employees or representatives to make any such representations either orally or in writing. If you are purchasing an existing outlet, however, we may provide you with the actual records of that outlet. If you receive any other financial performance information or projections of your future income, you should report it to the franchisor’s management by contacting Bentley Ritter at 225 Haddon Ave., Suite 2102A, Haddon Township, NJ 08108, 888-261-7038, Ext. 705, the Federal Trade Commission, and the appropriate state regulatory agencies",

When working with clients under a Franchisor supplied MSA, Snapchef will manage the billing and collection of these accounts on the franchisee’s behalf. Snapchef will also make the contractually required payments to the MSA client on your behalf. This may include payment due for marketing contributions, contract management fees or other similar costs. Current MSAs require payments up to 11% of gross revenue. This is a great advantage for the franchisee, as Snapchef will pay the franchisee for the value of the MSA client invoices each week.

We would much rather the owner stay heavily involved in the center business at all times. It is possible, initially, to have a full time hired Center Director (CD), to oversee the business with the owner/franchisee still heavily involved. This option, would take away from the initial profitability of the center if the Owner did not act as the CD, although 1st year profitability is still possible. ",

Financial performance information that differs from that included in Item 19 may be given only if: (1) a franchisor provides the actual records of an existing outlet you are considering buying; or (2) a franchisor supplements the information provided in this Item 19, for example, by providing information about possible performance at a particular location or under particular circumstances. 1. The foregoing data are historic financial performance representations. They are not projections of future performance. 2. “Gross Sales” means the total revenue derived from the sale of goods or services less sales tax, discounts, and returns. “Food Cost” means all of the cost of goods including food, paper and alcohol sold through the affiliate owned businesses. “Labor Cost” means all of the expenses, including management, to run and operate the business. 3. Our Affiliates do not pay royalties or marketing fees to us; however, we have shown the estimated expenditures (5% Royalty, 1% Marketing Fund) for each Affiliate had they incurred those expenses. 4. Some outlets have sold and earned this amount. Your individual results may differ. There is no assurance that you’ll sell or earn as much. 5. Written substantiation of the information contained in this Item 19 will be made available to prospective franchisees upon reasonable request. Except for what is included in this Item 19, we do not make any representations about a franchisee’s future financial performance or the past financial performance of company-owned or franchised outlets. We also do not authorize our employees or representatives to make any such representations either orally or in writing. If you are purchasing an existing outlet, however",

      "category": "Short DescriptionReal Estate commision advance companyPublic DescriptionOverview Traditionally, real estate agents and brokers earn a commission when they produce a buyer ready, willing and able to buy a property. Unfortunately, they do not get paid until settlement occurs, often 30, 60, or 90 days in the future. But the ongoing business expenses that must be paid by agents and brokers in order to operate their real estate businesses can be substantial. The problem they face, as with many small businesses, is that while these expenses tend to become due on a steady monthly basis, the cash flow generated on the income side of the business from commission receivables paid at settlement are far more sporadic. Hence the value to real estate agents and brokers of using a business factor such as COMMISSION EXPRESS to manage their cash flow needs in order to meet their ongoing operating, marketing and business development expenses.COMMISSION EXPRESS businesses provide commission advances to real estate agents and brokers by purchasing their earned but unsettled commissions (accounts receivable) at a discount. It’s a business to business factoring transaction by which a third party (Real Estate Company or Settlement Agent) is directed under the Uniform Commercial Code to pay Commission Express upon settlement, usually within 30 to 60 days from the purchase date.The prototype, Commission Express of Northern Virginia, has been operating in the Washington, DC metropolitan area since 1992 and has purchased thousands of accounts receivable. That experience enabled us to develop the materials, software and protocols that constitute the COMMISSION EXPRESS system.The Concept COMMISSION EXPRESS businesses apply the general factoring process to the specialty of factoring real estate sales commissions. We purchase these pending receivables on the basis of their quality as an asset and the professionalism of our customers.COMMISSION EXPRESS customers use our services because the process is easy, fast and reliable. They usually sell their receivables at the time of contract ratification.After completing an Application Packet, customers submit the necessary documents to COMMISSION EXPRESS for review. When approved, they can come to the COMMISSION EXPRESS offices to get their advance check or we will mail or wire the funds. The process usually takes less than two days.As a COMMISSION EXPRESS franchisee, you will be helping customers manage their cash-flow in exchange for the opportunity to purchase pending receivables at a discount. It is a situation where a reasonable exchange of values takes place, and where everyone has an opportunity to benefit.Candidate Buying PointsB2BProfessional and executive clienteleRegular business hoursHigh repeat businessOpportunities in all economic climatesHighly scalableLow employeesUnique business",
